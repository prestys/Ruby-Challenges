# In this set of exercises you'll build small classes
# Some will have no methods
# Some will have one or two simple methods
# Some will have one or two more complex methods
# Some classes are instantiated with args

# Each exercise will have the same format for the requirements
# The first line tells you what the class name should be
# If the class is instantiated with args, these come next
# The rest tells you what methods should be implemented

# Example requirements

# Greeter
# instantiated with a name. E.g. 'Bobby'
# hello
# returns 'hello, Bobby'
# goodbye
# returns 'goodbye, Bobby'

# Example solution

class Greeter
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def hello
    return 'hello, ' + @name
  end

  def goodbye
    return 'goodbye, ' + @name
  end
end

# Animal
# no methods required

# Vehicle
# no methods required

# Cat
# speak
# returns 'miaow'

# Dog
# speak
# returns 'woof'

# StringFormatter
# block_caps
# takes a string as an arg
# returns the string in block caps
# lower_case
# takes a string as an arg
# returns the string in lower case

# Calculator
# add
# takes two numbers as args
# returns the total
# multiply
# takes two numbers as args
# multiplies one by the other
# returns the result
# subtract
# takes two numbers as args
# subtracts the second from the first
# returns the result
# divide
# takes two numbers as args
# divides the first by the second
# returns the result

# Apprentice
# is instantiated with two strings
# a name and a cohort name
# name
# returns the name
# cohort
# returns the cohort
# full_details
# returns name and cohort, separated by one comma and one space
# 'E.g. "Rita Smith, June 2030"'

# Cohort
# is instantiated with three strings
# a name, a start_date and an end_date
# name
# returns the cohort name
# start_date
# returns the start_date as a Date object
# end_date
# returns the end_date as a Date object
# duration
# returns the number of days between start_date and end_date

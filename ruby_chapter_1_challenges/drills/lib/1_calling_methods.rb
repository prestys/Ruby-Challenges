# Below, you'll find lots of incomplete methods.
# Each one takes a single argument.
# Add a method body so that the method returns the correct value

# It's possible to complete each challenge using a single method
# Use the Ruby Docs and Google liberally

# String methods

# TASK: define a method that returns a string that is the same as a given string, but converted to upper-case characters.

# when the string is 'hello world'
# the method should return 'HELLO WORLD'

  # your code goes here
end

  # your code goes here
end

# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the string is 'hello'
# the method should return 5

  # your code goes here
end

# TASK: define a method that returns a float converted from a given integer.

end

# TASK: define a method that returns a string equivalent of a given integer.
# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the integer is 1
# the method should return '1'
def integer_to_string(integer)
  # your code goes here
end

# TASK: define a method that returns an integer that is one less than a given integer (don't worry about negative numbers for now).
# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the integer is 2
# the method should return 1
def return_previous_integer(integer)
  # your code goes here
end

# TASK: define a method that returns an integer that is one more than a given integer (don't worry about negative numbers for now).
# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the integer is 1
# the method should return 2
def return_next_integer(integer)
  # your code goes here
end

# Float methods

# TASK: define a method that returns a float that is rounded up from a given float.
# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the float is 1.1
# the method should return 2.0
def round_up(float)
  # your code goes here
end

# TASK: define a method that returns a float that is rounded down from a given float.
# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the float is 1.1
# the method should return 1.0
def round_down(float)
  # your code goes here
end

# TASK: define a method that returns a string that is equivalent to a given float.
# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the float is 1.1
# the method should return '1.1'
def float_to_string(float)
  # your code goes here
end

# TASK: define a method that returns a integer that is converted from a given float.
# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the float is 1.1
# the method should return 1
def float_to_integer(float)
  # your code goes here
end

# TASK: define a method that returns a boolean that evaluates whether or not a given float is positive.
# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the float is 1.1
# the method should return true
# when the float is -1.1
# the method should return false
def float_is_positive?(float)
  # your code goes here
end

# TASK: define a method that returns a boolean that evaluates whether or not a given float is negative.
# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the float is 1.1
# the method should return false
# when the float is -1.1
# the method should return true
def float_is_negative?(float)
  # your code goes here
end

# Symbol methods

# TASK: define a method that returns a symbol that inverts the case of each character for a given symbol.
# EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
# when the symbol is :Hello
# the method should return :hELLO
def swap_the_case_of_a_symbol(symbol)
  # your code goes here
end

# TASK: define a method that returns a string that is the equivalent of a given symbol.

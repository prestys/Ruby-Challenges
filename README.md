# Ruby Challenges

## Learning objectives
- Practise ruby syntax
- Run rspec files and interpret the error message to make informed changes to improve the code

(Peer review sections) 
- Sharing work on github
- Understanding and evaluating code you haven't written
- Communicating through the github pull request review procedure

## Setting up on your own computer

Make a fork of this repository. Go to your copy of this repo on your github account and click the green code button. Then copy the url for the repo.  

In a terminal on your computer, in your projects directory, run the following command: (it will make a new directory to copy the repo into).

```bash
git clone url-you-copied-from-green-code-button
```

Then change into that directory:


```bash
cd ruby_challenges
```

You now have a local copy of this Makers repo. Because you cloned it, a remote called origin is already set up with a link to your repo on github. You can see that with:

```bash
git remote -v
```

## Working in branches

You should create a branch to make changes to your repo. That way, if you make a mistake that breaks a project, you can always go back to the last good version.

You will also need to make a branch for each of your peer review tasks. We would like those branches to have only the changes you need for those challenges.

Make those branches now, before making any changes:

```bash
git switch main
git branch chapter1-program-challenge
git branch chapter3-program-challenge
```

You can make other branches to work on the drills, too.

Once you have made some changes, staged and committed them, you can send those changes to the remote repo using:

```bash
git push -u origin the-branch-name
```

## Doing the drills

There are instructions in the [chapter 1 folder](./ruby_chapter_1_challenges/README.md)

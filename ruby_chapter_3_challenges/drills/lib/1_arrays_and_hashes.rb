# These exercises will initially recap basic hash and array methods
# Then they'll go a bit deeper on both topics
# Some exercises will require your knowledge of both arrays and hashes

# Arrays I

# fourth_element
# takes one array as an arg
# returns the fourth element

# average
# takes an array of numbers
# returns the average (the mean)

# lowest_squared
# takes an array of numbers
# returns the lowest number squared

# highest_squared
# takes an array of numbers
# returns the highest number squared

# Hashes I

# values_summed
# takes a hash where the values are numbers
# returns the total of all the values

# first_two_keys
# takes a hash
# returns the first two keys

# first_two_values
# takes a hash
# returns the first two values

# Arrays II

# starts_with_a
# takes one array as an arg
# returns only elements starting with 'a'

# starts_with_a_vowel
# takes an array as an arg
# returns only the elements that start with a vowel

# reverse_each_element
# takes an array as an arg
# reverses each element
# E.g. when the arg is ['one', 'two']
# it returns ['eno', 'owt']

# sort_by_last_letter
# takes one array as an arg
# returns the array, sorted by the last letter

# greater_than_5
# takes one array as an arg
# returns only numbers greater than 5

# greater_than
# takes one array and one number as args
# returns only the elements that are greater than the number provided

# less_than
# takes one array and one number as args
# returns only the elements that are less than the number provided

# words_shorter_than
# takes one array and one number as args
# returns only the elements than have fewer characters than the number provided

# all_above?
# takes an array and a number as args
# returns true if all elements are greater than the number provided

# all_below?
# takes an array and a number as args
# returns true if all elements are less than the number provided

# multiply_each_by
# takes one array and one number as args
# returns a new array with each element multiplied by the number provided

# Hashes II

# where_value_below
# takes a hash and a number as args
# returns key value pairs where the value is less than the number provided

# where_key_starts_with
# takes a hash and a letter as args
# returns key value pairs where the key starts with the letter provided

# add_key_value_pair
# takes a hash, a key and a value as args
# returns a the hash with the new key and value added

# sort_by_key
# takes a hash
# sorts key-value pairs by key

# sort_by_value
# takes a hash
# sorts key-value pairs by value

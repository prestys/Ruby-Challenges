# Ruby Challenges

## Learning objectives
- practise ruby syntax
- run rspec files and interpret the error message to make informed changes to improve the code

(peer review sections) 
- sharing work on github
- understanding and evaluating code you haven't written
- communicating through the github pull request review procedure

## Setting up on your own computer

Make a fork of this repository. Go to your copy of this repo on your github account and click the green code button. Then copy the url for the repo.  

In a terminal on your computer, in your projects directory, run the following command: (it will make a new directory to copy the repo into).

```bash
git clone url-you-copied-from-green-code-button
```

Then change into that directory:


```bash
cd ruby_challenges
```

You now have a local copy of this Makers repo. Because you cloned it, a remote called origin is already set up with a link to your repo on github. You can see that with:

```bash
git remote -v
```

## Working in branches

You should create a branch to make changes to your repo. That way, if you make a mistake that breaks a project, you can always go back to the last good version.

You will also need to make a branch for your peer review task -- see later instructions for that part.

Let's make a branch to prepare for working on the chapter 1 drills. The following both makes the branch and switches to it.

```bash
git checkout -b chapter1-drills
```

Once you have made some changes, staged and committed them, you can send those changes to the remote repo using:

```bash
git push -u origin chapter1-drills
```

## Doing the drills

There are instructions in the [chapter 1 folder](./ruby_chapter_1_challenges/README.md)
